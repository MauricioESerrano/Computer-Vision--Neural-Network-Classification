# Classification-Neural-Network

Created a convolutional neural network (CNN) using TensorFlow and Keras to classify over 47,000 different images - Trained ML model using the Fashion MNIST dataset and transitioned to a dataset of various bird species.

We started with the MNIST dataset due to its simplicity, and from there worked our way up to building a model for the bird classification problem. We built a CNN for this task, which required a lot of experimentation and research.
